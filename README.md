# AI Automation Tool

## Overview
The **AI Automation Tool** is a web-based platform that allows users to create automated AI workflows by dragging and connecting AI-powered operations. Users can design workflows that automate various tasks such as text generation, code writing, image processing, file conversion, and more without writing any code.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Login and manage personalized workflows.
- **Drag-and-Drop Workflow Builder**: Users can visually create automation pipelines.
- **AI-Powered Operations**:
  - Text generation (e.g., content writing, summarization, translation)
  - Code generation and formatting
  - File format conversion (PDF, CSV, DOCX, etc.)
  - Image processing (background removal, enhancement, filtering)
  - Diagram and chart creation
  - Clipboard automation
- **Workflow Execution**: Once a user builds and connects the workflow elements, a single click executes the entire automation.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instant AI-powered operations based on the sequence designed by the user.
- **Export and Share**: Save, export, and share automated workflows.

## How It Works
1. **Login/Register**: Users sign in to the platform.
2. **Create a Workflow**:
   - Drag and drop different AI modules (e.g., "Write Code", "Copy to Clipboard", "Remove Background", etc.).
   - Connect modules in a logical sequence.
3. **Run the Workflow**: Click the "Run" button to execute the defined automation.
4. **Get Output**: The system processes the workflow and delivers the expected results automatically.

### Example Workflows
#### 1. **Code Generation Workflow**
- Drag **Write Code** module
- Drag **Copy to Clipboard** module
- Connect the two modules
- Run the workflow to generate code and copy it automatically

#### 2. **Image Processing Workflow**
- Drag **Input Image** module
- Drag **Remove Background** module
- Drag **Add Background Color** module
- Drag **Image Output** module
- Connect the modules and run the workflow
